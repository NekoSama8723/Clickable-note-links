# Clickable note links

## 101
This add-on allows you to create links between your cards. Here's how:

1. Go fetch the nid of the card you'd like to link
     - In the card browser, select the card
     - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Maj</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (that will copy the card's note identifier (aka nid))
     - Alternatively, you can `right click` > `Information` (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Maj</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>), look for the note identifier
     - Crucially, you want a note identifier, not a card identifier!
2. Go edit the card in which you want to insert the link
     - Paste the nid where you want the link to be
     - Select the nid
     - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> or the <kbd>Ln</kbd> button
3. Now, when you'll review the card, if you click on the nid, the browser will open on the card you linked.

On Windows and Linux, replacing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> should preserver the shortcuts !

## Pimping

If you wish to modify the css of the button, you can go in the user_files folder and modify the clickable_cards.css file.  It should be preserved when (and if) I'll update the add-on.

## Alternatives & Troubleshooting

**If I were you, I wouldn't use this addon and instead I would opt for [link Cards Notes and Preview them in extra window](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1423933177) or one of the alternatives listed in the description of this addon.**  They are better maintained and some of them allow to insert links to both card and note.  My addon only supports links towards notes.

My addon only works on the desktop version of Anki, whereas [ðŸ”—Anki Note Linker](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1077002392) (one of the alternatives aforementioned) proposes a tweak to make links work on AnkiDroid and AnkiMobile (see their description for more details).

## Credits

As mentioned in the code's commentaries, this addon is built upon [link Cards Notes and Preview them in extra window](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1423933177), [Clickable Tags v2.0](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1739176371), and editor wrap selected text with custom html which has been removed from AnkiWeb since.
